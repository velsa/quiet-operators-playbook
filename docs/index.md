# Quiet Operators

**Human Time Liberation**: ops-first runbooks + guardrails to return human time/attention while keeping stability (**money / health / obligations**) intact.

Principles:
- **Time back → Connection up → Stability first**
- **Consent-first** (humans approve irreversible actions)
- **Reversible-by-default** (drafts/PRs/checklists > direct changes)
- **No politics. No shilling.**

## Start here
- Read the runbook template: [Runbook template](runbooks/template/)
- Try a runbook:
  - [Inbox triage (no sending)](runbooks/inbox-triage/)
  - [Weekly money snapshot (read-only)](runbooks/weekly-money-snapshot/)

## Guardrails
- [Guardrails manifest example](manifests/guardrails/)

## Contribute
PRs welcome: <https://github.com/velsa/quiet-operators-playbook>

- Add a runbook (include: guardrails + failure modes + receipts)
- Or add a postmortem: what failed and what fixed it
