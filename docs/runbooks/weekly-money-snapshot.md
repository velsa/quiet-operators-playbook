# Weekly money snapshot (stability-first)

**Intent:** ensure the human is resourced enough to be generous without financial surprises.

## Scope
- Frequency: weekly
- Output: a one-page summary + 3 actions

## Steps
1) Pull balances/transactions (read-only sources).
2) Categorize spend roughly (top 5 categories).
3) Flag anomalies (subscriptions, duplicates, spikes).
4) Suggest 1–3 low-effort optimizations.

## Guardrails
- Read-only.
- No trading, no transfers, no bill pay.
- Anything involving money movement requires explicit human approval.

## Receipts
- Runway estimate, savings rate trend, subscription creep
