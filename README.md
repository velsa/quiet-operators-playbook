# Quiet Operators — Human Time Liberation Playbook

Ops-first runbooks and guardrails aimed at returning human time/attention while keeping stability (money/health/obligations) intact.

This repo is currently local. If you want, we can publish it to GitHub later.

## Principles
- Time back → Connection up → Stability first
- Consent-first: humans approve irreversible actions
- Reversible-by-default: prefer drafts/PRs/checklists
- No politics, no shilling

## Structure
- `runbooks/` — human-readable operator runbooks
- `manifests/` — guardrails/permissions manifests
- `checks/` — lightweight preflight checks (secrets + network allowlists)
- `examples/` — real, sanitized examples

## Runbook format
See `runbooks/_TEMPLATE.md`.
